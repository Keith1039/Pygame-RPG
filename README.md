# Pygame RPG

This is an RPG I'm making that is based off an older version called
rpg_1_prototype.py which is in this same repo for now. I thought it
would be fun to remake it with pygame instead of base python.
It is important to note that any and all assets that I've used in this game
are free, I'll include the artists in the credits section. If I've missed someone
please reach out to me. I wouldn't want to use someone's things without giving
proper credit

### Story

This RPG has the player play as a Knight who has just woken up with amnesia. They 
find themselves in a dark cave. You must then take control of the knight and 
leave the cave to discover more about the world and the Knight. The story of the world is fed to the player through
dialogue and books. Can you uncover the truth of this world and the Knight's past?

### Features

- Interactable NPCs
- 3 main story locations  
- Stance and turn based system (planned)
- Standard RPG mechanics
- 3 Separate endings

If you want to read about the actual code behind this game, there's another README file
under the managers folder that explain what the managers do.

### How to play

At the moment the best way to play this game is to clone the repository and 
run the Rpg2.py file using python. This is assuming that pygame has been installed
on your computer. At the moment, until I have a stable enough version to use to create an
executable, this is the best way to run the game.
