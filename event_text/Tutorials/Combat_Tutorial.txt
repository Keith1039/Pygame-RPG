In a world full of monsters knowing how to fight is essential!
When a fight starts there's no stopping until one of you is dead so try your best!
Luckily for you most enemies are lone wolves, meaning you only have to deal with one at a time!
In combat, there are three options. Attack, defend and item.
Attack, well, attacks your enemy dealing damage based on your attack and their defence.
Defence braces your character to receive an attack, halving the potential damage. Knowing when to defend is a crucial way to stay alive.
Item let's you use the consumable items in your inventory. This is your go to way to heal. Scarfing down bread and potions in a fight is crucial to survival!
Who attacks first depends on your agility stats. If your enemy is faster they'll go first. If not, you'll go first.
The turn order matters for the attack and item options.
If you're slower than your opponent that means that you'll attack second or heal second so be careful.
regardless of who goes first you'll always get your defence off so when you think you're in danger don't hesitate to defend!
Goodluck and try not to die!
