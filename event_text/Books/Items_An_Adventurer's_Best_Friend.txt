Items are quite important to wanderers and adventurers!
Some Items can be combined and be used in order to help out in tough fights!
Some Items require special situations for their effects to truly show!
Whenever you're stuck just look at what you have and you'll sure to find a way forward!

Rion:'Would've been better if you just gave me a list of things I can make with items....'
