Day 15,
'I don't know why but the dragons have turned against us! Our winged protectors are now our fiercest enemies.'
'I heard Astrea has lost their champion... It looks like they'll fall soon.'
'Dammit! Are we just going to die like this?!'
'No. I can't give up now! If the dragons were the greatest weapons humanity had then we simply must make weapons that surpass even them!'
'I will gather the strongest men and women and arm them with the strongest weapons!'
'They will be the blades that will strike down the threats to my empire! I mustn't waver! The lives of my people depend on this'
The rest is ruined.
Rion: Sorry my prince. Your gamble failed.
Rion: Wait why did I...
Rion: .......
Rion':  'No... There's no point thinking about it... I just need to keep moving and eventually everything will come back.
