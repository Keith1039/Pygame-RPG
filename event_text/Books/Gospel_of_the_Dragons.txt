'Dragons are holy creatures. Created by the gods themselves to watch over mankind.'
'Through their divinity they are able to use any and all magic.'
'As beings of high divinity dragons themselves are considered gods and must be worshipped as such.'
'Any action taken against a dragon, especially the act of slaying one is a grave sin.'
'Attempting to replicate the power of the dragons is also a grave sin.'
'The strongest and most noble dragons are capable of transforming into a humanoid form to help guide our wayword race.'
There's more but it's just different ways to go about worshipping the dragons.
Rion: The church huh...
