In this world there are monsters, dragons and humans. The dragons protected the humans from the monsters and helped them expand.
Monsters vary in size in strength, weak monsters like spirits are relatively harmless.
Goblins, kobalds and other smaller monsters can be felled by a skilled enough warrior.
Humans CANNOT fight against the stronger monsters like high-level undead and...
The book proceeds to name a large amount of monster races that humans cannot fight.
Dear reader, if you try to fight these monsters I hope you're ready for a gruesome death. The only exception to this rule is me of course!
You think whoever wrote the book is incredibly arrogant and should die in a hole.
Rion:What a weird book, but I have nothing else to go on right now.... monsters though... do they really exist.
Rion: I wonder if I'll ever meet the author of this book.
You think of what the author might be like. You picture an arrogant person and smug person.
Rion: ughhh nevermind I don't want that.
