You see the Gargoyle you had just defeated, far less ancient than when you encountered it.
???: Your duty is over. I'm not gonna last much longer.
The Gargoyle shakes it's stone head
???: You're as stuborn as your creator. I had a feeling that this may happen.
???: In that case... I have one last order for you.
???: Guard this for me. It's something that should never see the light of day ever again. 
???: Attack anyone that comes to claim it.... Even if... Even if it's me.
The Gargoyle makes the saddest expression it can make with it's stony visage.
???: I understand that I've given you a hard task my friend but I can't take back that order.
???: This is my final order. A selfish order and one that will cause you pain.
???: Still, you're the only one I can ask. Please, I'm asking as a friend, not as your master.
The Gargoyle hesitates before giving a sad nod
???: Thank you. Here is the item.
A hand is outstretched clutching a small item 
The Gargoyle moves from it's position and takes it from the man.
???: I don't have much time.
The man puts his hand on top of the gargoyles stone head, patting it gently
???: Goodbye my friend. May we never meet again. #says this because if they do, one of them die
???: 'I'll see my duty through.'
