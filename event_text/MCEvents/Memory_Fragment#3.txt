In front of you is the same Amadeus as before. He looks terrible.
The bright king from before is nowhere to be seen. It's as if he is crushed under the stress.
Amadeus: This is a risky process... I can't say for sure you'll survive.
Amadeus: If the situation wasn't dire I would have waited for the results to stabilize...
someone replies but you can't seem to hear them.
Amadeus: You trust me....
You nod
Amadeus sighs
Amadeus: The process should last for a week.
Amadeus: The rest of your personal knights have already been undergoing the process. You're the last one.
Amadeus: We'll do what we can to buy you time.
Amadeus: Don't die my friend, I order you,  Rion', 'to come back alive using my authority as emperor.
You smile and nod
An unknown amount of time passes
You sit still in the void, not feeling anything and not knowing anything.
When your eyes open your pupils are scarlet red
There is one thought in your head.
killkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkillkill
You jerk awake, sweating and breathing hard.
Rion: It was all a dream....?
Rion: That was... me...
Amadeus had clearly said your name.
Rion: if I remember... will I...
Rion: Will I... go back to being that... thing?
