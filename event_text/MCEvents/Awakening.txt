???: It seems like it's time for you to wake up.
???: This ... story is to be an intresting one. With these eyes I forsee three possible endings.
???: I advise you to think carefully before you make your decisions. Your very fate depends on it.
???: Now then, the stage is set and the actors are waking from their slumber. Without further ado, the play will begin. Do be sure to entertain me.
You wake up to the feeling of cold metal. You crawl out of the sarcophagus tired and confused.
???: my name... that's right.. I'm.
This will only be asked once, if you leave the character name blank a default name will be used instead
???: That's right. My name is  Rion
Rion: It looks like there's some stuff with me
Rion Gained a rusty dagger!
Rion Gained a sword!
Rion Gained a sword?
Rion: This sword... whenever I try unsheathing it my body freezes. Honestly, it seems quite sinister but it might be a clue as to who I am.
Rion: Other than my name, I can't remember anything.why I'm here, who I am... I can't recall anything.
Rion: For now though, I should leave this place so that I can find out more about myself.
you swing the sword around for a bit.
Hopefully I won't have to use this, as for why I can wield this so well... Was I a mercenary or something?
Rion equipped the sword.
