Mysterious shopkeep: Hello to my favourite customer. You seem to want something other than my great items. 
Rion:Word on the street is that you have a way out of this place. Is that true?
Mysterious shopkeep: My my... Aren't you well informed. But yes... I do have a way out
Rion:Then-
Mysterious shopkeep: Ah ah ah... That's not how this works. Our relationship is transactional. You give me what I want. I give you what you want.
Rion:*sigh* then what do you want.....
The shopkeeper smiles.
Mysterious shopkeep: Haha, now that's what we like to hear. Anyway I want you to deal with the mysterious murders around town. 
Rion:Do I look like a detective to you?
Mysterious shopkeep: No but you do look like the two things I like in my customers. Capable and desperate.
Rion:Ugh Fine.
Mysterious shopkeep: That's the spirit! Good luck!
Rion: 'it's no good, I don't think she'll budge until I do as she says.'
Rion: 'I should ask around the town to find more clues to this mystery killer.'
