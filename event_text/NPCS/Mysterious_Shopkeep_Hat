Rion: So.... What's with the hat?
Her hat was commically large and ressembled the hat worn by a witch.
Despite it's age, she took very good care of it, often cleaning it and sewing it back up.
Mysterious shopkeep: Just so you know it's not for sale. 
Rion: Obviously I don't want to buy it.
Rion: You just take very good care of it so I was wondering about it's backstory.
Mysterious shopkeep: Oh, it's a memento of a really important person. So until I see him again I'll take good care of the hat.
You remark that her smile is genuine for once. Like she was recalling a fond memory.
Rion: 'so you can smile like that too...'
Mysterious shopkeep: Jealous?
Rion: Obviously not.
