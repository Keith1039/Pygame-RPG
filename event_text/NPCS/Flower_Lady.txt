Flower Lady: Hey you want a flower? Normally I charge but I'm in such a good mood today!
Rion:What's the occasion?
She smirks
Flower Lady: Father David spoke to me and complimented my gardening skills saying in his wonderfully deep voice, 'these flowers have grown to be as beautiful as you.'
'For some reason you refuse to believe that he said that.'
Rion:Who even is this Father David character?
Flower Lady: HUH?!?! You don't even know that?!
Flower Lady: Father David is the head priest for this place! He's such a devoted man that he seared the cross of saint Helios on his arm!
Flower Lady: To be honest, men like you stand no chance.... Shoo, you don't even deserve a flower if you ask stupid questions like that.
The Flower Lady walks off
Rion:A cross seared onto his arm?
Flower Lady: Don't talk to me! Anyone who doesn't know how great father David is can go die!
