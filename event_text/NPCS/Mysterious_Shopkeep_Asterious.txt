Mysterious shopkeep: So I heard you defeated the undead in the ruins.
Rion: 'so that's what that was.'
Rion: Yeah I guess so. It was really strong.
Mysterious shopkeep: Asterious was really powerful when he was alive but should be less powerful as an undead.
Mysterious shopkeep: Even so, I don't think he's weak enough for you to beat him. So how exactly did you defeat him?
Rion: It wasn't the most honourable way but I coated my weapon in poison and well...
Mysterious shopkeep: 'That make sense, for a moment I thought he...'
Mysterious shopkeep: Asterious died to poison in his life.
Rion: So the poison I used was the same one that killed him originally?
Mysterious shopkeep: No, there's no way you could get your hands on that.
Mysterious shopkeep: 'That' poison could even kill lesser dragons after all.
Mysterious shopkeep: An undead is naturally weak to what killed them. Even common rat poison would have a similar effect.
Rion: Oh, I see. I'll keep that in mind.
