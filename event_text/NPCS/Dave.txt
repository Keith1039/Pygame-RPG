'Dave:  'Names Dave, Haven't seen you around here. Did you come from the outside?
Rion: I'm not sure...
'Dave:  'tch and here I thought you would have a way to leave. Get lost. That damn dragon is just keeping us in here like livestock!
Rion: What do you mean?
Dave: If we leave past this towns border a dragon will kill us.
Dave pointed to a black corpse in the distance. Burned to a crisp by dragon fire.
You look around to see that there wasn't just one of these. There were many simply left unnatended.
Rion: What the hell...
Rion: 'looks like getting out will be tricky..'
