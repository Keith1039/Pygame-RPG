Rion:I have a question.
Mysterious shopkeeper: Sure, depending on what it is you'll have to pay though.
Rion:Always trying to earn more gold huh..
Rion:Anyway, I hear dragons and humans got along. What happened?
Mysterious shopkeep: True, there was a time like that.
Mysterious shopkeep: At this time monsters were even more common than they were now.
Mysterious shopkeep: The dragons took pity on humanity, guarding them and providing them shelter. We clung to them like children.
Mysterious shopkeep: However no child can stay under their parents forever. Humanity grew in both numbers and strength.
Mysterious shopkeep: What they lacked in strength they made up for in terms of numbers and technology.
You're completely entranced in her story. She notices and smiles.
Mysterious shopkeep: Anddddd that's the end of the free trial!
Rion:Huh?!
Mysterious shopkeep: Don't be so shocked, there's limits to what I know as well you know.
Mysterious shopkeep: Some people say the dragons attacked humanity because of an evil man
Mysterious shopkeep: Some say the dragons made a pact with the gods to protect humans for a certain amount of time and it expired.
Mysterious shopkeep: The church believes that humanity as a whole commited a sin and now this is our punishment.
Mysterious shopkeep: At this point it's impossible to tell. It happened so long ago after all.
Rion:I see... I guess that makes sense. i guess there are somethings even you don't know huh.
Mysterious shopkeep:'Sorry, I can't give you the answers you want. You must obtain them yourself.'
