Drunk man: HAHHAHAHAHAHHA, It'll kill us all.
Rion:What will kill us all?
Drunk man: The wolfman! I saw It, It ate someone and the next day they were put as missing!
Drunk man: People say I'm insane but I know what I saw! It had a cross on it's arm and blood on it's teeth.
Drunk man: He'll really do it! He'll kill us all!
You try to approach the man but he just keeps muttering nonesence.
Rion: It's no good. He's too shaken up.
