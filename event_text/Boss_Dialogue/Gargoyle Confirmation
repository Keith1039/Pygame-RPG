CONDITION HERE
You approach the statue that holds a stone halberd. On it's head sat horns and on it's back were bat-like wings
Rion: 'What a weird statue... Whatever I'll just go...
You take a step forward
Your instincts scream out from the wave of blood lust directed at you
You jump back
The ground where you stood now has a deep groove in it.
Rion: 'If I didn't jump out of the way my legs would be gone!'
You look at the stone sentinel, now in a new pose after swinging the halberd
Rion: 'I don't think it'll react so long as I stay in this room.' 
Rion:This things too strong, I'm not sure if I can win if I face it head on.
Rion: No, there's no need to rush. I should prepare.
